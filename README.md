## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.

2. The p-value of this model is 5.35e-11. This is less than the assumed significance level: 0.05%. Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis. This also indicates that the slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero.

3. This linear model does predict MPG of MechaCar prototypes effectively. This is because the r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of the variability of the response data can be explained by this model.
